# ReleaseRaccoon

A music release newsletter frontend application built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Backend available here: https://github.com/jaivalis/release-raccoon

## How to develop

First install deps:

```shell
yarn
```

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Do some changes on the code. The changes are automatically applied with the help of Next.js [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh).

When you are happy with your changes proceed with committing them. [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
will trigger Prettier, Linter and Tests for the changed files according to [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

You can also manually run them individually.

Prettier:

```shell
yarn prettier
```

Eslint (with Typescript):

```shell
yarn lint
```

Tests (Jest):

```shell
yarn test
```

## Deployments

This project uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as it's hosting platform.  
Vercel builds a production optimized version using:

```shell
yarn build
```

You can do the same locally. After you build, start the production server that uses that build:

```shell
yarn start
```

### Development deployments

Each PR creates automatically a Preview env where one can visually verify the results.

### Production deployments

Each commit to `master` triggers a production deployment.

> Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Dark mode

Dark mode state is initialized by reading the OS preference or to `light` if that fails. It's also customizable by the user.

## API Endpoints

API endpoints for the app are documented in [this OpenAPI](./openapi.yml) export.  
A [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) is required for each request. | Get my followed artists |

> OpenAPI export was generated based on the backend project [here](https://github.com/jaivalis/release-raccoon#readmeTODO)

## Supported browsers
