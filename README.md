[![Lines of Code](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=stavros-liaskos_release-raccoon&metric=ncloc)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=stavros-liaskos_release-raccoon)

A music release newsletter frontend application built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Backend available here: https://github.com/jaivalis/release-raccoon

## How to develop

Make a copy of `.env` to `.env.local`.

```shell
$ cp .env .env.local
```

More on how to generate this values [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs)

First install deps:

```shell
$ yarn
```

Start the development server:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the website. That's it!

Do some changes on the code. The changes are automatically applied with the help of Next.js [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh).

When you are happy with your changes proceed with committing them. [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
will trigger Prettier, Linter and Tests for the changed files according to [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

You can also manually run them individually.

Prettier:

```shell
$ yarn prettier
```

Eslint (with Typescript):

```shell
$ yarn lint
```

Tests (Jest):

```shell
$ yarn test
```

## Mock Data

You can work with mock server data.  
Simply set env `BE_BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:3000` and all API calls will be forwarded to NextJS local API and served with mocked data from `/mocks/responses/`

## Deployments

This project uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as it's hosting platform.  
Vercel builds a production optimized version using:

```shell
$ yarn build
```

You can do the same locally. After you build, start the production server that uses that build:

```shell
$ yarn start
```

### Development deployments

Each PR creates automatically a Preview env where one can visually verify the results.

### Production deployments

Each commit to `master` triggers a production deployment.

> Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Dark mode

Dark mode state is initialized by reading the OS preference or to `light` if that fails. It's also customizable by the user.

## API Endpoints

API endpoints for the app are documented in [this OpenAPI](./openapi.yml) export and are based on the BE project [here](https://github.com/jaivalis/release-raccoon#readmeTODO).  
A [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) is required for each request.  
To generate a ts schema:

```shell
$ npx openapi-typescript openapi.yml --output types/schema.ts
```

## Supported browsers

List supported browsers:

```shell
$ npx browserslist ">0.3%, not ie 11, not dead, not op_mini all"
```
